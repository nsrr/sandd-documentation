## About

The Sleep and Development (SandD) study aimed to examine how personal alcohol experience and/or family history of alcohol abuse or dependence are related to sleep, biological rhythms, performance, and mood. It included cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of sleep, circadian timing, and alcohol use in young people with and without parental history of alcohol abuse/dependence and with varying amounts of alcohol experience.

To date, there have been 3 waves of data collection. The first wave was collected at the baseline visit, the second collection was at the follow-ups (6 months to 2 years), and the last collection wave was at the 2.5-year final visit. During these visits, various questionnaires were given to participants during the consenting period, orientation, saliva collection night, and in-lab visits. 

## Methods

### Actigraphy collection

At each assessment, participants wore an actigraph on their nondominant wrist (Mini-motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) and kept a daily sleep diary in which they documented their sleep pattern. This monitoring occurred for at least one week before coming to the laboratory to measure the salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) phase on a weekday evening. Participants were free to select their sleep times, and they were instructed to sleep at home alone and not remain awake all night. Activity data were collected in 1-minute epochs using a Zero-Crossing Mode (ZCM) and filter setting 18 (the manufacturer’s setting for frequency bandpass of 2 to 3 Hz). Further verification of bedtimes and wake-up times were provided with twice-daily telephone calls to the laboratory’s time-stamped answering machine, immediately before going to bed and immediately after waking.

### Actigraphy scoring

Scoring was completed manually by scorers using the actigraph file, diary, call-in log, questionnaires, scoring sheets, and record summary. Actigraphic sleep data were analzyed using the Action-W2 software (version 2.3.20, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA) to estimate sleep/wake using the validated "Sadeh" algorithm. Each sleep episode was inspected within a scoring interval spanning 15-minutes before participants reported trying to fall asleep to 15-minutes after reported wake-up time on their daily sleep diary.

- Sleep Onset: The first minute of at least 3 consecutive minutes of sleep occurring after 15 minutes before the reported bed time or tried to fall asleep time, whichever one works. (E.P. Bradley Hospital Sleep Lab).
- Sleep Offset: The last minute of at least 5 consecutive minutes of sleep occurring before 15 minutes after the reported wake-up time or get out of bed time, whichever one works. (E.P. Bradley Hospital Sleep Lab).
- Sleep Minutes: The minutes of the sleep interval scored as sleep.
- Nap Rule: If a subject reports a nap that ends within 60 minutes of their reported bedtime and/or begins within 60 minutes of their reported wake (or out of bed) time, the nap(s) should be included (scored) as part of the main sleep interval. For clarification: <59 minutes, apply nap rule, 60+ minutes, do not apply nap rule.

### Questionnaires

From 2002 to 2007, there were 3 total waves of questionnaires that participants were expected to complete. The first wave was collected at the baseline visit, the second collection was at the follow-ups (6 months to 2 years), and the last wave was at the 2.5 year final visit. During the baseline visit, forms were given to the participant during the consenting period, orientation, saliva collection night, and in-lab. Baseline forms included: TLFB (both consenting and in-lab), Sleep Questionnaire Assessment of Wakefulness (SQAW), Substance Use Questionnaire, Alcohol and Drug Inventory, Drunkenness Questionnaire (adult and regular forms), Food Preference List, What I am Like, Student Coddington, Horne/Ostberg/Morningness/eveningness, and more. During the Follow-ups (6 months to 2 years) and 2 1/2 Year Visit (Final Visit), similar forms were given to participants during the orientation and Saliva Collection Night. Follow-up and final visit forms included: Actigraph Responsibility, Substance Use Questionnaire, Alcohol and Drug Inventory, Drunkenness Questionnaire, What I am Like, YSR (11-18 years old), 6-month follow-up Student Coddington, Horne/Ostberg/Morningness/eveningness, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) or Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-Y) (depending on age), RCMAS (What I Think and Feel), Student Medication List and TLFB.

## Data de-identification

The SandD team reviewed each file to identify any dates or other potentially identifying variables. Dates or other identifiers in file were removed using SPSS 'Drop variables' syntax. The team reviewed files again before saving. File names with identifiers removed are appended with 'deID'. Prior to uploading to the secure NSRR Dropbox all files were reviewed again by the COBRE RA to ensure that no identifying variables remained.

## Data overview

11 types of data were collected during the data collection process. The data types are described below:

- Dems_Scores_dlmo_ETOHhx_season_pds and ALL files: Patient and study information as well as questionnaire answers that were collected at and before baseline.
- ADI (Consenting): ADI was collected from the questionnaires administered during the consenting period. (Consenting Questionnaire).
- BDI (Saliva Collection Night): BDI was collected from the questionnaires administered during Saliva Collection Night (Beck Depression Inventory Questionnaire).
- CESD (Saliva Collection Night): CESD was collected from the questionnaires administered during Saliva Collection Night (CESD Questionnaire).
- Coddington Parent (Mailed around time of orientation): CodPar was collected from the Coddington Parent Questionnaire that was sent to participants around the time of Orientation.
- Coddington Student (Saliva Collection Night): Coddington Student was collected from the Coddington Student Questionnaire that was administered to participants during Saliva Collection Night.
- Mood_Sleepiness (In-Lab, Saliva Collection Night): Mood_Sleepiness was collected from the Mood Sleepiness Questionnaire that was administered to participants both In-Lab and Saliva Collection Night.
- Neuropsych Testing (In-Lab): Neuropsych testing data was collected using questionnaires during the in-lab visit.
- RCMAS “What I Think and Feel” (Saliva Collection Night): RCMAS data was collected during Saliva Collection Night in questionnaire format.
- Scored Actigraphy (Actigraphy monitoring for 1-2.5 weeks prior to in-lab): Scored Actigraphy data was collected from participants previously scored actigraphy data.
